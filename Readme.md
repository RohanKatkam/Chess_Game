# Chess Game

Yet another chess game, without zero changes as compared to the original OG game. The aim of this project to get hands on experience with C++ and SFML graphics library.

Note the chess piece ID is a unique non zero identity number assigned to a piece, and it cannot be 0. 0 is special number that indicates the square is unoccupied

# How to run
